# FIT1008 Lecture Slides and Code

Feel free to read up the slides to get an early grasp of how FIT1008 looks like

<br>

## Key Takeaways:
1. Lecture Slides are never enough, do your own extensive research on how each implementation works <i>(especially for all the Python topics like Stacks, Queues, Hash Tables, etc.)</i>
2. This unit is all about implementation, so remembering code is practically useless <i>(remembering parts of it which you know will never change is an exception)</i>
3. Yes, MIPS and Python in this unit are linked <i>(MIPS will allow you to understand data structures better)</i>
4. Rather than stress about coding the thing, take time to understand each concept. You will thank yourself for doing that in the future, even if you did not do well in this unit.

## Note:
1. If you want to download a specific slide, you can click "Download" on doc in Github
2. If you want to download the whole thing, i suggest you might as well clone the repo (same goes to if you want to download only the Python code)

<br>

## How to Clone:
1. Make sure git is installed in your computer
2. Fork this repo by clicking "Fork" on Github <i>(To prevent any unwanted errors)</i>
3. choose a directory you want to clone the repo on, and type <br> `git clone https://github.com/<username>/fit1008.git` <br> whereby `<username>` is your Github username
4. Be patient and wait for it to fully clone the repo
5. Wallah! Your totally personally customised lecture slides are in ur local directory

## To Update Slides to Your Repo:
1. `git add *`
2. `git commit -m "<your commit message>"`
3. `git push origin main` or `master` depending on your default github branch
4. If you're kind enough to want me to update it as well, you can make a pull request on my repo, how? Google.
